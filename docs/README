This is the documentation directory. The white papers are in four formats
for full readability across various platforms while maintaining its format.
The one that should work on ALL platforms is the Postscript file. You can
send that directly to your printer and have a nice paper *yuck* copy. There
are also Star Office 5.1, Wordperfect, and MS Word 95 documents.
