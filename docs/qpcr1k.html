(raison d'etre)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; page-break-before: auto"><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif">	Basically
Javaman and I came up with an idea to create the PCR-1000 API and
command line interface at Mogel's house party. We were piss drunk at
the time and decided what a better way to contribute to both our
hobbies at once.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm"><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif">	Of
course we were stupid. After all, we were drunk. We didnt know how
much work it was really going to be. And all it would have been was a
passing thought. But now we have finally (four months later) finished
up the first usable version (one that won't erase your harddrive ;)
ehhe.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm"><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif">	We
started from the ground up. The first file that I started writing was
the PCRDEF.H file. This file is the definitions of the most of the
known radio control codes. Check out the documentation that we have
on that file. We are sure you will find it interesting. The second
layer that we started writing was the <I>Primitive Communications
Object.</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> This is the low level
layer that actually communicates with the radio. And finally, what
the GUI/CLI actually uses the PCP object. </SPAN></FONT>

About The Styles</FONT></FONT></P>

<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Styles</SPAN><BR>Basically,
	you have several different styles you can impliment when compiling
	the GUI. Depending on your current platform, you can compile it to
	fit right in with whatever navtive windowing system you are using.
	So if, for example, you are compiling it to run on a Windows 95
	machine, you can give the command line option at configure time to
	<I>win95</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>

		<BR>With the CDE style, you can set the GUI to mimic a CDE widget
		set. This will complement your Sun Solaris box and seamlessly fit
		right in.</FONT></P>
		<LI><P><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif">motif<BR>Running
		MWM as your window manager? Well, worry not! For setting the style

		are <I>fortunate</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> enough to be
		running this on an X-Windows server on your Windows 95 box. Well,
		if you can scare away the BSOD's long enough to play with this
		application on your win95 box, setting this style will make it look
		like it was just </SPAN><I>made</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
		natively for your Windows machine.</SPAN></FONT></P>
		<LI><P><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif">sgi<BR>And of

Started</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="new century schoolbook, serif">	Did it
compile? YAY! Ok, well, now let's get started really quickly. When
you did a <I>make install</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> the
binaries were installed into the /usr/local/bin (by default, it could
have been changed by you to a different </SPAN><I>prefix</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">)
Three binaries were installed into this directory, and were stripped
of all debug code before the install (this is a good thing, it makes
the binaries smaller.)</SPAN></FONT></FONT> Now what's left is to
check out the GUI. You can run the GUI by issueing the command
<I>/usr/local/bin/qpcr1k</I> after a short second you will notice the
radio click and the GUI come up. 
</P>
<P>	If you have never run this program before you will notice that
the frequency is tuned to <I>146.000.000</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
MHz. The volume and squelch is all the way down, the CTCSS is off,
the filter is set to </SPAN><I>15 kHz</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
step size is set to </SPAN><I>1 kHz</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
and Mode set to <I>NFM</I>. </SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">	I am not going to go into a whole
scanning lesson, but two way communications in the VHF/UHF/SHF band
are mainly 15kHz, NFM. While broadcast channels are set to 230 kHz,
WFM.  Let's start by quickly tuning in a broadcast band frequency.</P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=4>	<FONT SIZE=3>To scan
select a frequency and press the scan button. It will flicker with
your available options. It will also dim the unavailable buttons
during scan mode.  Your four available options are step up scanning

CTCSS squelch is unused. The radio will stop for five seconds at the
next frequency which opens its squelch <B>regardless of the CTCSS
setting</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">. After the five
seconds, the radio will continue to scan in the selected scan mode
until another mode is selected or the scan button is depressed.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=4>Memory Channels</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>	To add a memory channel,
navigate channel up or down until you get to the VFO (channel 0).
Select a frequency, ctcss, mode, and filter. Then press the channel
add (+) button. In the radio display section, you will see that the
channel will change to the next free channel, and your settings for
that frequency will be stored in the channel indicated.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>	To edit a memory channel,
navigate to the channel who's information will be altered. Alter the
ctcss, mode, filter or frequency, then press the channel add button.

<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>	To remove a channel,
navigate to the channel which you want to remove. Then press the
channel remove (-) button. Your channel setting will be downshifted

<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=4>Profile Management</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">	Click on the gear icon on the top, or
select Edit-&gt;Profile from the menu. This should actuate the
Profile Editor. In the profile editor,  you can edit your personal

<P STYLE="font-style: normal">	To edit any of the above settings,
double click on the child item of the tree for which you are editing.
For example, if you are editing channel 1 information double click on
channel 1.  This should actuate an edit channel information dialog
box. Here you can set a channel description, frequency, filter,
ctcss, or mode. When complete, press the commit button of this dialog
box to commit the information in the view. Lastly, when done editing
items press the commit button of the profile editor to save the
information globally.</P>
